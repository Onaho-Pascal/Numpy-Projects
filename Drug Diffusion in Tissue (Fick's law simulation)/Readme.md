# Drug Diffusion Simulation in Tissue

This project simulates 1D drug diffusion in biological tissue using Fickâ€™s Second Law and NumPy. It's useful for understanding how substances distribute over time, which is important in biomedical engineering for drug delivery modeling.

## What It Does
- Simulates diffusion in 1D tissue space
- Visualizes drug concentration over time
- Applies Euler's method to solve partial differential equation (PDE)

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
